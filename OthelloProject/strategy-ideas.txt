-count the number of tokens to get the utility of a state
-some token positions are more valuable (edges and corners) because they cannot be captured
-avoid positions directly next to the edges and corners as the adversary will capture them and get the advantage of holding these valuable positions

Optimazations:
- Cut off and choose based on a heuristic.
- Parallel solution
- Save GameState in hashmap, and look up best move for given gamestate (memorization in dynamic programming)
- Do one large calculation for first moves. Next moves, just look up best moves based on gamestate.

check some strategies on the internet (othello tutorials) and find tricks that we could implement in addition to using the weights
