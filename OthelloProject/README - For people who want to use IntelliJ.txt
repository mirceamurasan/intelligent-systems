- Open IntelliJ.
- Press "Import Project". (Very important that you do NOT click "Open Project")
- Locate the "OthelloProject" folder in the explorer, and expand it (be sure that it is chosen).
- Click next... next... next... next... next... next... finnish.
- I would suggest that you write code in IntelliJ, and compile + run in CMD.
- *.xml and *.iml has been added to gitignore (you don't have to do anything).
- Profit$$$
